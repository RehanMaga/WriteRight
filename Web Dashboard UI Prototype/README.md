# 🌐 WriteRight - Web Dashboard UI Prototype

This folder contains the **UI/UX prototype** for the WriteRight therapist web dashboard.  
It is **not** a fully functional web application — it is intended to demonstrate the planned design and user interface for managing patient sessions, viewing progress, and analyzing performance.

---

## 📋 Purpose
The web dashboard was designed as a **therapist-facing interface** to complement the WriteRight iPad app.  
While the iPad app is used by patients to draw shapes, the web dashboard is intended for therapists to:
- View patient history
- Track progress trends over time
- Access shape classification and scoring summaries
- Plan personalized rehabilitation sessions

---

## 🖥 Features in the Prototype
- **Login Page** (mockup only, no authentication)
- **Dashboard Overview** with patient statistics
- **Patient Profile Pages** with performance history
- **Charts and Graphs** to visualize accuracy and score trends
- **Session History Table** showing shape-by-shape evaluation

> ⚠ **Important:** All data in this prototype is mock/sample data.  
> No real backend or database is connected.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used (Prototype Only)
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** for layout and styling
- **Bootstrap / TailwindCSS** (if applicable in your code) for responsive design
- **Chart.js / D3.js** (if applicable) for mock data visualizations
- Static assets and dummy JSON for simulating content

---

## 📌 Limitations
- No real-time connection to the iPad app
- No machine learning inference in the browser
- No backend (Node.js, Flask, or database integration)
- All interactions are front-end simulations

---

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Connect to the iPad app’s data via a secure API
- Enable real-time synchronization of patient progress
- Store and retrieve session data from a cloud database
- Add therapist account management and secure login

## 📜 Academic Context
This dashboard prototype is part of the **WriteRight Final B.Sc. Project in Information Systems** at the University of Haifa.
